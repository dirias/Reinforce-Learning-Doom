# Reinforcement Learning with VizDoom and Dueling DQN

This project implements reinforcement learning using VizDoom, a platform for creating Doom-based AI experiments, and Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (Dueling DQN) agents. The goal is to train an agent to play Doom scenarios effectively through reinforcement learning techniques.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- VizDoom


## Usage

1. Configure the parameters in the code, such as learning rate, discount factor, batch size, memory size, etc.
2. Run the main script (ipynb) to train the Dueling DQN agent on VizDoom scenarios.
3. Evaluate the trained agent's performance and observe its behavior in the game.
